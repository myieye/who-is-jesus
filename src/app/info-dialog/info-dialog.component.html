    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Everyone should know who Jesus is! This site is a streamlined tool for discovering what the Gospels have to say about Him and even what He has to say about Himself.</p>
    
    <h3>Bible Translation</h3>
    <p>All verses are quoted from the <a href="https://worldenglish.bible/">World English Bible</a> (WEB) translation. The WEB was chosen, because it both aims to be true to the original text and is in the public domain. I encourage you to read the verses in other translations as well. For that purpose I've provided links to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/">Bible Gateway</a>. By hovering over a verse (not necessary on smaller devices) you'll find a link that will show the verse in several other translations.</p>

    <h3>Chronology</h3>
    <p>Chronological sorting is based on <a href="http://www.lifeofchrist.com/Life/Harmony">Harmony of the Gospels</a> from <em>LifeofChrist.com</em>. This is of course only an approximation as is indicated on their website.</p>
