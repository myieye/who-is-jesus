# Who Is Jesus?

Everyone should know who Jesus is! This is a streamlined tool for discovering what the Gospels have to say about Him and even what He has to say about Himself.

## Bible Translation

All verses are quoted from the [World English Bible](https://worldenglish.bible/) (WEB) translation. The WEB was chosen, because it both aims to be true to the original text and is in the public domain. I encourage you to read the verses in other translations as well. For that purpose I've provided links to [Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/). By hovering over a verse (not necessary on smaller devices) you'll find a link that will show the verse in several other translations.
